            <p> <li> The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time. </li> </p>
            <p> <li> Love is not about how many days, months, or years you have been together. Love is about how much you love each other every single day. </li> </p>
            <p><li>  The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. </li> </p>
            </ul>
